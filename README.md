## Real time projects with rest APIs to perform CRUD operations via PostMan on a database 

These projects are based on lessons given by Chad Darby'course: Spring and Hibernate on Udemy, which is a "must-be" - in my humble opinion - both for an entry level or even en experienced developer in Spring. This course is very seasoned and give you a systematic approach in the world of Spring and Hibernate. 

Ok, for this repository I am showing four projects to perfom CRUD operations on a table in MySQL. The difference is in which implementation I used to perfom the ORM based on the JPA standard.

- First: Hibernate
- Second: JPA
- Third: Spring data JPA
- Spring data Rest

Now, I will show some screenshot that I took when I was testing the code with PostMan... In general for the first three projects the response is similar, the differences is in how you implement operations on the back-end to perform them. The project with Spring data JPA is less boilerplate than the two former: Hibernate and JPA. Why?  Because you do not need to write code for every operation like: get, put, delete or post. They are implemented by Spring Data JPA!



In this last part, I will show some screnshoot when I was testing basic CRUD operations via Postman in the last project: Spring Data Rest. This library has more advanced features like pagination, sorting and send responses according to HATEOAS specification.
